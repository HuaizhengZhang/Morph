Overview\r\n-------------------\r\nMorph is an open source cloud transcoding system. It can leverage the scalability of the cloud infrastructure to encode and transcode the video files in fast speed, and dynamically provision the computing resource to accommodate the time-varying workload. Morph is implemented in Python. It can be accessed via RESTful API, command line interface (CLI), and RPC.\r\n\r\n###1.1 System Layers\r\n\r\nOur system provides cloud-based video transcoding service for the end-users. It consists of three layers, including the Service Interface Layer, Task Scheduling Layer, and Resource Management Layer. The functionalities of each layer are detailed as follows: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/cap-ntu/Morph/blob/master/DOC/system.png\" width=\"60%\" height=\"60%\">\r\n\r\n####Service Interface Layer\r\n\r\nIt handles the user requests for submitting new transcoding tasks, querying task status and obtaining the transcoded video files. It provides two kinds of interfaces for the video transcoding service, including Restful API and Command Line Interface (CLI). With the Restful API interface, users can submit the request through HTTP POST/GET method; with CLI, users can submit the request by executing command line on the system background.\r\n\r\n####Task Scheduling Layer\r\n\r\nIt manages a queue of the pending tasks, and determines the execution sequence of the tasks. When there is idle computing resource in the computing cluster, the task scheduler will pick the head-of-queue task to execute. It first partitions the video file into segments, and then distributes the video segments to many workers for transcoding. After transcoding the video segments into the target resolution or bitrate, the transcoding workers will send back the transcoded video segments to the task scheduler. Finally, the task scheduler will concentrate the transcoded video segments into one video file. \r\n\r\n####Resource Management Layer\r\n\r\nIt manages many virtual machines, on each of which runs a transcoding worker. Since the transcoding request rate is changing over time, the resource manager layer is responsible for dynamically adjusting the number of running VMs to minimize the operational cost, according to the current workload.\r\n\r\n![GitHub](https://github.com/cap-ntu/Morph/blob/master/DOC/workflow.png \"workflow\")\r\n\r\n###1.2 System Workflows\r\n\r\nThe task scheduler, after receiving the transcoding request, will first insert the incoming task into the task queue, and then determines the execution sequence of the pending task. When there is idle transcoding workers in the VM cluster, the task scheduler will select the head-of-queue task to execute. On performing a new task, the task scheduler first splits the video file into several segments, and then distributes the video segments to many transcoding workers. After a segment has been transcoded into the target resolution by the transcoding worker, it will be sent back to the task scheduler. The task scheduler continuously checks whether all of the segments of a video file have been finished. If so, it will merge the transcoded video segments into on entire video file.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe execution time for a transcoding task maybe very long if the video file is very large. To address this problem, we provide three alternative modes to perform a transcoding task. First, the system can define video segment duration in the configuration file and each of the video file would be split into video blocks according to the configuration. Each of the video blocks will be transcoded in parallel on multiple VM instances. With this method, all of the video blocks in the system have the same duration. Second, the duration of the video blocks can be determined by the task scheduling algorithms. For instance, the task scheduling algorithm can determine the duration of the video block according to the video deadline and the video size. Third, the system can perform the video transcoding without video segmentation. In this case, the entire video file will be sent to a transcoding worker directly and the transcoding task would be performed on that server. The system can select one model from the three alternatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Getting Started\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe system provides three kinds of interface for providing video transcoding service, including Restful API, Command Line Interface, and RPC. In general, the system interfaces can be divided into two categories: task submission and status query. Task submission is to submit a transcoding task to the system by specifying parameters. Status query is to query the progress of the transcoding task. The details of each kind of interfaces are given in the following sections.\r\n\r\n###3.1 Restful API\r\n\r\nThe parameters of HTTP POST method for submitting a new task. The video location is specified with URL. \r\n\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n     'url': 'http://155.69.52.158/test.mp4',\r\n     'target_resolution': '100x100 200x200',\r\n     'priority': 5\r\n     \r\n</html>\r\n\r\nThe parameters of HTTP POST method for submitting a new task. The video location is specified with a local path. The video file will be uploaded to the server for video transcoding. \r\n\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n     'video_file': open('/home/Public/test.mp4','rb'),\r\n     'target_resolution': '100x100 200x200',\r\n     'priority': 5\r\n \r\n</html>\r\n\r\nThe parameter of HTTP Post method for querying the task status. \r\n\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n     url = 'http://155.69.52.158/transcoder/get_progress'\r\n     key = {'key' : 'G8QKmGXX'}\r\n     \r\n</html>\r\n\r\n###3.2 Command Line\r\n\r\nParameters for the command line:\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n     -l: local video file\r\n     -u: url of the video file\r\n     -t: task id (optional)\r\n     -p: priority (optional)\r\n     -s: resolution\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nSubmit a new transcoding task by CLI\r\n\r\n`python submit_task.py -l /home/Videos/test.mp4 -s 640x360 426x240`\r\n\r\nQuery task status\r\n\r\n`python query.py –k taskid`\r\n\r\n###3.3 RPC\r\n\r\nWe adopt the SimpleXML as the RPC library, the APIs for submitting transcoding task and querying task status are as follows:\r\n\r\nSubmit a new transcoding task (URI can be a URL or local file path)\r\n\r\n`put_trans_task(URI, bitrate, width, height, priority, task_id = None)`\r\n\r\nQuery the task status\r\n\r\n`get_progress(task_id)`\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Example\r\n-----------\r\nSubmit a transcoding task by the command line interface: \r\n\r\nthe file path of the original video file is '/home/Videos/test.mp4', specified by '-l'\r\n\r\nThe taget resolutions are 640x360, 426x240, specified by '-s'\r\n\r\n`python submit_task.py -l /home/Videos/test.mp4 -s 640x360 426x240`\r\n\r\nQuery the progress of the task with the ID 'ddsdd123', specified by '-k'\r\n\r\n`python query.py –k ddsdd123`\r\n\r\n[5.
