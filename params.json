It can leverage the scalability of the cloud infrastructure to encode and transcode the video files in fast speed, and dynamically provision the computing resource to accommodate the time-varying workload. Morph is implemented in Python. It can be accessed via RESTful API, command line interface (CLI), and RPC. \r\n\r\nThe system architecture is shown in the following figure. The system is composed of the following layers:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/cap-ntu/Morph/blob/master/DOC/system.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\">\r\n\r\n* Interface Layer\r\n\r\nIt interacts with the users for processing the transcoding requests and preprocessing the video contents. The system provides 3 types of service interfaces, namely, command line interface (CLI), remote procedure call (RPC), and RESTful API. The users can submit the transcoding tasks and query the transcoding progress via the service interfaces. For each of the user submitted transcoding tasks, it will estimate the required computing time for the task and segment the video files into video blocks for transcoding in parallel on the workers.\r\n\r\n* Scheduling Layer\r\n\r\nThe user submitted transcoding tasks will be put into the scheduling queue. The task scheduler sequences the pending tasks in the queue according to the scheduling policy and the QoS profiles of the tasks. Whenever the master node receives a transcoding request from the worker, the task scheduler will select a video block from the pending tasks for dispatching by applying the scheduling policy. The transcoded video blocks on the worker will be sent back to the master for concentration.\r\n\r\n* Provisioning Layer\r\n\r\nIt manages the transcoding workers for dynamic resource provisioning. Our system can adopt the virtual machines (e.g., KVM ) or containers (e.g., Docker) for resource virtualization. Each VM instance or container runs a worker. The worker will request a video block from the master node whenever it it idle. The worker will transcode the video block into the target representations, which will be sent back to the master node.\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/cap-ntu/Morph/blob/master/DOC/workflow.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\r\n\r\nThe user submit a transcoding task by uploading a video file and specifying the transcoding parameters. The video content will be segmented into independent video blocks according to the group of pictures (GOP) structure. The video block information of the task will be then put into the scheduling queue. \r\n\r\nWhen an idle worker requests a video block from the master node, the scheduler determines which video block in the scheduling queue will be selected for dispatching by applying the scheduling policy. The worker will transcode the video block into the target representation, and then send back the target representation to the master node. The video blocks in the scheduling queue can be requested and transcoded by the workers in parallel. \r\n\r\nThe master node continuously checks the transcoding status of the video blocks of each task. If all the video blocks of a task have been finished successfully, the master node will concentrate the video blocks into one video file. Then, the transcoding task is finished and the target representations of the video content are ready to be downloaded by the users.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nSystem Requirement\r\n\r\n* [ubuntu 14.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/)\r\n* [Python 2.7.6](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/)\r\n* [ffmpeg](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu)\r\n* [Mysql](https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/mysql.html)\r\n\r\nPlease click the above links for the installation of the dependent software.\r\n\r\nIt may require to install some lacked libraries, e.g., pycurl, mysqldb.\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get update    \r\nsudo apt-get install python-pycurl\r\nsudo apt-get install python-mysqldb\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 1: Clone the code from Github\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/cap-ntu/Morph.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 2: Revise the configuration file **config.py**\r\n\r\nAll executable programs read the configuration information from config.py.\r\nMake sure each item is set with appropriate value according to your system configuration.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\n#the IP address of the master node\r\nmaster_ip       = \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n\r\n#Remain unchanged\r\nmaster_rpc_port = \"8091\" \r\nmaster_rev_port = \"9001\"\r\nmaster_snd_port = \"9011\"\r\n\r\n#The working path of the master node, keep unchanged\r\nmaster_path = \"./master/\"\r\n\r\n#The working path of the worker node, keep unchanged\r\nworker_path = \"./worker/\"\r\n\r\n#the configuration of Mysql\r\nmysql_ip        = \"127.0.0.1\"\r\nmysql_user_name = \"root\"\r\nmysql_password  = \"\"\r\n\r\n#Remain unchanged \r\nmysql_db_name   = \"morph\"\r\n\r\n#the duration for each of the video block\r\nequal_block_dur = 60*2\r\n\r\n#the number of threads for task preprocessing\r\npreproc_thread_num = 10\r\n\r\n#algorithm for task scheduling\r\nsch_alg = 'fifo'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 3: Initialize the database and tables in Mysql   \r\n```bash\r\npython init_db.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 4: Change to the directory 'Morph', and start up the Master node by executing the following command.\r\n```bash\r\nnohup python master.py > master_error_msg &\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 5: Change to the directory 'Morph', start up the Worker node. This needs to be executed on each of the worker node. \r\n```bash\r\nnohup python worker.py > worker_error_msg &\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 6: Check the log and the error message of the master node.\r\n```bash\r\ntail master_error_msg\r\ntail master.*.log\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck the log and the error message of the worker nodes.\r\n```bash\r\ntail worker_error_msg\r\ntail worker.*.log\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Programming Interface\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe system provides three kinds of interface for accessing the service, including Restful API, Command Line Interface, and RPC. The users can use these interfaces to submit new transcoding tasks and to query the transcoding progress of a task.\r\n\r\n### Restful API\r\n\r\nThe parameters of HTTP POST method for submitting a new task. The video location is specified with URL. \r\n\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n     'url': 'http://155.69.52.158/test.mp4',\r\n     'target_resolution': '100x100 200x200',\r\n     'priority': 5\r\n     \r\n</html>\r\n\r\nThe parameters of HTTP POST method for submitting a new task. The video location is specified with a local path. The video file will be uploaded to the server for video transcoding. \r\n\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n     'video_file': open('/home/Public/test.mp4','rb'),\r\n     'target_resolution': '100x100 200x200',\r\n     'priority': 5\r\n \r\n</html>\r\n\r\nThe parameter of HTTP Post method for querying the task status. \r\n\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n     url = 'http://155.69.52.158/transcoder/get_progress'\r\n     key = {'key' : 'G8QKmGXX'}\r\n     \r\n</html>\r\n\r\n### Command Line\r\n\r\nParameters for the command line:\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n     -l: local video file\r\n     -u: url of the video file\r\n     -t: task id (optional)\r\n     -p: priority (optional)\r\n     -s: resolution\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nSubmit a new transcoding task by CLI\r\n```bash\r\npython cli_submit.py -l /home/Videos/test.mp4 -s 640x360 426x240\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuery task status\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython cli_query.py –k taskid\r\n```\r\n\r\n### RPC\r\n\r\nWe adopt the SimpleXML as the RPC library, the APIs for submitting transcoding task and querying task status are as follows:\r\n\r\nSubmit a new transcoding task (URI can be a URL or local file path)\r\n```bash\r\nput_trans_task(URI, bitrate, width, height, priority, task_id = None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuery the task status\r\n```bash\r\nget_progress(task_id)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to use this software is via command line. With this method, you do not need to configure the webserver or write the code for calling RPC. There are two programs serving as the command line, **cli_query.py** and **cli_submit.py**. Note that the **config.py** should be kept a copy with these two programs, since they need to the configuration information from it. \r\n\r\n* Submit a transcoding task by the command line  \r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython cli_submit.py -l /home/Videos/test.mp4 -s 640x360 426x240\r\nReturn: Task ID\r\n```\r\nIn the above command, the file path of the original video file is '/home/Videos/test.mp4', specified by '-l'. This needs to be a valid local video file in the master node. The taget resolutions are 640x360, 426x240, specified by '-s'.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython cli_submit.py -u http://aidynamic.com/video/bunny.mp4 -s 640x360 426x240\r\nReturn: Task ID\r\n```\r\nThe user can also specify the URL of the original video file by '-u' to submit a task. In the above command, the URL of the original video file is 'http://aidynamic.com/video/bunny.mp4', specified by '-u'. The master node will first download the video file and then perform the transcoding operations. \r\n\r\n* Query the transcoding progress of a task with the task ID\r\n```bash\r\npython cli_query.py –k ddsdd123\r\nReturn: \r\n1. Progress of the task.\r\n2. The file path of the target video file if it has been finished. \r\n```\r\nIn the above command, the task ID is 'ddsdd123', specified by '-k'. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\nThe duration of the test video file is 138 minutes. The resolution is 1920x1080, and the bitrate is 2399 kb/s. The video data is encoded in H.264, and the audio data is encoded in AAC. The CPU frequency of the servers is 2.10GHz. The master node is allocated with 8 CPU cores, and the memory size is 8GB. The worker node is allocated with 4 CPU cores, and the memory size is 2GB. We use the Docker for the resource allocation. \r\n\r\nWe first measure the video segmentation time for splitting the video file into equal-duration video blocks. The duration of each video block is 2 minutes. The FFmpeg command for the video segmentation is show as follow:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nffmpeg –i PV4h.mp4 -f segment -segment_time 120 -c copy -map 0 -segment_list PV4h.list PV4h_%03d_.mp4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe video segmentation time for the video file is 46 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe then measure the transcoding time for the test video file with different number of transcoding workers. The target resolution is 480x360. We illustrate the transcoding time in the following table:\r\n\r\n| Worker Number  | FFmpeg | 1 | 5     | 10    | 15    | 20    | 25    | 30    |\r\n|------------------   |------  |------ |------   |------   |------   |------   |------   |------   |\r\n| Transcoding Time (s)  | 1775 | 1843 | 605   | 369   | 271   | 213   | 194   | 181   |\r\n| Speed-up Ratio    | 1x  | 0.96x | 2.9x  | 4.8x  | 6.5x  | 8.3x  | 9.1x  | 9.8x  |\r\n\r\nThe transcoding time for using a standalone FFmpeg on a single server is 1775 seconds. If the system has only one active worker, the transcoding time is 1843 seconds, which is larger than the standalone ffmpeg. The overhead comes from the video segmentation, transmission, and concentration for transcoding the video file in a distributed manner. With more active workers to transcode the video blocks in parallel, the overall transcoding time decreases, achieving larger speed-up ratio. \r\n\r\nThe FFmpeg command for video block concentration is as follow\r\n```bash\r\nffmpeg -f concat –i PV4h_480x360.list -c copy PV4h_480x360.mp4\r\n```\r\nThe video block concentration time is 13 seconds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS RELEASED UNDER THE MIT LICENSE (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c), 2015, NTU CAP\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
