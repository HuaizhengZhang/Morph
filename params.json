  "body": "### Welcome\r\nMorph is an open source cloud transcoding system. It can leverage the scalability of the cloud infrastructure to encode/transcode the video files in fast speed, and dynamically provision the computing resource according to the workload. Morph is implemented in Python, however, it is easy to access the service via  RESTful API, command line interface (CLI), and RPC. For the details of the system design, please refer to the report.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHaving trouble with it? Please feel free to contact us.
